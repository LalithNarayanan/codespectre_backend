## Analysis of COBOL Programs

Here's an analysis of the provided COBOL programs, detailing database calls, web service interactions, CICS calls, and SQL queries.

### Program: LTCAL032

*   **External Calls:**
    *   **COPY LTDRG031.** - This is a copybook inclusion, meaning that the code from LTDRG031 is inserted into this program during compilation.  This copybook likely contains data structures used in the DRG calculations.

*   **SQL Queries:**  None

*   **CICS Calls:**  None

### Program: LTCAL042

*   **External Calls:**
    *   **COPY LTDRG031.** - This is a copybook inclusion, meaning that the code from LTDRG031 is inserted into this program during compilation.  This copybook likely contains data structures used in the DRG calculations.

*   **SQL Queries:**  None

*   **CICS Calls:**  None

### Program: LTDRG031
