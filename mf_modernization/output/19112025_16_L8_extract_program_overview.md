# Step 1: Program Analysis for LTCAL032

## LTCAL032
### Overview
- LTCAL032 is a COBOL program designed to calculate Long-Term Care (LTC) payments based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) for the fiscal year 2003.
- It receives patient and provider data, performs edits, assembles pricing variables, calculates payments, including outliers, and returns the results.
- The program uses a copybook `LTDRG031` which appears to contain DRG-related data.
- It determines the payment based on the length of stay and other factors, potentially applying short-stay or outlier adjustments.

### Business Functions
-   DRG-based Payment Calculation: Determines the payment amount based on the DRG code.
-   Length of Stay (LOS) Calculation and Adjustment:  Adjusts payments based on the length of stay, including short-stay calculations.
-   Outlier Payment Calculation: Calculates additional payments for cases exceeding a cost threshold.
-   Data Validation and Edits:  Performs validation checks on input data and sets return codes to indicate errors.
-   Blend Payment Calculation: Calculates blended payments based on facility rates and DRG payments.
