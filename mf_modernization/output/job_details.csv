  - ProgramName: LTCAL032
    Overview: >
      This program calculates LTC payments using PPS rules. It performs billing edits,

      sets output fields. It uses `LTDRG031` as a DRG lookup table.

      - Uses DRG table LTDRG031 for lookups.
      - Applies normal, short-stay, outlier, and blended payment methodologies.
      - Considers provider-specific data, dates, budget neutrality.
    DataValidation:
      - B-LOS must be numeric and >0 (Error code 56)
      - B-COV-CHARGES must be numeric (Error code 58)
      - B-LTR-DAYS must be numeric and <=60 (Error code 61)

  - ProgramName: LTCAL032
    Overview: >
      This program calculates LTC payments using PPS rules. It performs billing edits,
      DRG lookups, payment computations (including short-stay, outliers, blends), and
      sets output fields. It uses `LTDRG031` as a DRG lookup table.

    BusinessRules:
      - Calculates payment for LTC DRGs.
      - Uses DRG table LTDRG031 for lookups.
      - Applies normal, short-stay, outlier, and blended payment methodologies.
      - Considers provider-specific data, dates, budget neutrality.
    DataValidation:
      - B-LOS must be numeric and >0 (Error code 56)
      - B-COV-CHARGES must be numeric (Error code 58)
      - B-LTR-DAYS must be numeric and <=60 (Error code 61)

    ErrorHandling:
      - Stores error state in PPS-RTC 50-99.
      - On error, PPS-RTC triggers skip/exit logic.

  - ProgramName: LTCAL032
    Overview: >
      This program calculates LTC payments using PPS rules. It performs billing edits,
      DRG lookups, payment computations (including short-stay, outliers, blends), and
      sets output fields. It uses `LTDRG031` as a DRG lookup table.

    BusinessRules:
      - Calculates payment for LTC DRGs.
      - Uses DRG table LTDRG031 for lookups.
      - Applies normal, short-stay, outlier, and blended payment methodologies.
      - Considers provider-specific data, dates, budget neutrality.
    DataValidation:
      - B-LOS must be numeric and >0 (Error code 56)
      - B-COV-CHARGES must be numeric (Error code 58)
      - B-LTR-DAYS must be numeric and <=60 (Error code 61)
      - ... # Add all others
    ErrorHandling:
      - Stores error state in PPS-RTC 50-99.
      - On error, PPS-RTC triggers skip/exit logic.

  - ProgramName: LTCAL032
    Overview: >
      This program calculates LTC payments using PPS rules. It performs billing edits,
      DRG lookups, payment computations (including short-stay, outliers, blends), and
      sets output fields. It uses `LTDRG031` as a DRG lookup table.

    BusinessRules:
      - Calculates payment for LTC DRGs.
      - Uses DRG table LTDRG031 for lookups.
      - Applies normal, short-stay, outlier, and blended payment methodologies.
      - Considers provider-specific data, dates, budget neutrality.
    DataValidation:
      - B-LOS must be numeric and >0 (Error code 56)
      - B-COV-CHARGES must be numeric (Error code 58)
      - B-LTR-DAYS must be numeric and <=60 (Error code 61)
      - ... # Add all others
    ErrorHandling:
      - Stores error state in PPS-RTC 50-99.
      - On error, PPS-RTC triggers skip/exit logic.

      - Uses DRG table LTDRG031 for lookups.
      - Applies normal, short-stay, outlier, and blended payment methodologies.
      - Considers provider-specific data, dates, budget neutrality.
    DataValidation:
      - B-LOS must be numeric and >0 (Error code 56)

  - ProgramName: LTCAL032
    Overview: >
      This program calculates LTC payments using PPS rules. It performs billing edits,
      DRG lookups, payment computations (including short-stay, outliers, blends), and
      sets output fields. It uses `LTDRG031` as a DRG lookup table.
    Paragraphs:
      - Name: 0000-MAINLINE-CONTROL
        Description: Main control paragraph orchestrating overall processing.
        Calls:

    BusinessRules:
      - Calculates payment for LTC DRGs.
      - Uses DRG table LTDRG031 for lookups.
      - Applies normal, short-stay, outlier, and blended payment methodologies.
      - Considers provider-specific data, dates, budget neutrality.
    DataValidation:
      - B-LOS must be numeric and >0 (Error code 56)
      - B-COV-CHARGES must be numeric (Error code 58)
      - B-LTR-DAYS must be numeric and <=60 (Error code 61)
      - ... # Add all others
    ErrorHandling:
      - Stores error state in PPS-RTC 50-99.
      - On error, PPS-RTC triggers skip/exit logic.

## Error Checks

**Validation Checks**:
- What is being validated
- How errors are flagged

**Error Handling**:
- What happens when errors occur
- Are bad records written to error datasets?

**Logging**:
- What information is logged (PUT statements)
- Where logs are written

---
