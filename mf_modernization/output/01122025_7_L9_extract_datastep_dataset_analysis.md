Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (once they are provided) and furnish the requested details for each program, formatted in Markdown as specified. I will look for datasets, input sources, output datasets, variable usage, `RETAIN` statements, and `LIBNAME`/`FILENAME` assignments. I will maintain a consistent format across all analyses.

I am now waiting for the content of the SAS programs.  Please provide the code for:

*   `01_transaction_data_import`
*   `02_data_quality_cleaning`
*   `03_feature_engineering`
*   `04_rule_based_detection`
*   `05_ml_scoring_model`
*   `06_case_management_output`

Once you provide the code, I will generate the analysis for each program.
