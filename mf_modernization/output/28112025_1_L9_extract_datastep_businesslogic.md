Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (once provided) and provide the requested details for each program, formatted in markdown. I will adhere to all instructions, including the use of markdown elements and the exclusion of code snippets unless specifically requested.

I am ready to begin the analysis. Please provide the content of each SAS program (from `01_transaction_data_import` to `06_case_management_output`) so I can start the analysis.
