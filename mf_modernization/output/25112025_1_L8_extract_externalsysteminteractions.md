## Analysis of COBOL Programs

Here's an analysis of the provided COBOL programs, `LTCAL032`, `LTCAL042`, and `LTDRG031`, detailing their database calls, web service calls, CICS calls, and SQL queries.

### Program: LTCAL032

*   **Database Calls:** None
*   **Web Service Calls:** None
*   **CICS Calls:** None
*   **SQL Queries:** None

```markdown
**Summary:** The program `LTCAL032` does not interact with any external systems or databases. It is a standalone COBOL program that performs calculations based on input data and internal tables.

```

### Program: LTCAL042

*   **Database Calls:** None
*   **Web Service Calls:** None
*   **CICS Calls:** None
*   **SQL Queries:** None

```markdown
**Summary:** The program `LTCAL042` does not interact with any external systems or databases. It is a standalone COBOL program that performs calculations based on input data and internal tables.

```

### Program: LTDRG031

*   **Database Calls:** None
*   **Web Service Calls:** None
*   **CICS Calls:** None
*   **SQL Queries:** None

```markdown
**Summary:** The program `LTDRG031` does not interact with any external systems or databases. It is a standalone COBOL program that defines a table of DRG codes, relative weights, and average lengths of stay. This table is likely used as input data for the calculation performed by the LTCAL032/LTCAL042 programs.
