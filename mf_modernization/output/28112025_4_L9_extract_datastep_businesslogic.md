Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (once you provide them) and provide the requested details for each program, formatted in markdown. I will adhere to the instructions, including the use of markdown elements, and the emphasis on listing DATA steps, business rules, conditional logic, loop processing, key calculations, and data validation. I will not include tables or code snippets unless specifically requested.
