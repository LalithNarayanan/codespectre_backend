Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (JOB, SASPOC, DUPDATE, and DREAD) when you provide them.  I will then provide a detailed analysis of each program, focusing on the requested aspects of error handling and logging, formatted using Markdown.  I will adhere to the instructions precisely.  I am ready for the code.  Please provide the content of each SAS program.
