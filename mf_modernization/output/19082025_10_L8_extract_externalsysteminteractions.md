Here's an analysis of the provided COBOL programs:

## Program: LTCAL032

**1. Calls to Databases, Web Services, Online Transaction Systems, or Other Programs:**

*   **COPY LTDRG031:** This statement indicates that the program is including or referencing code from another source member named `LTDRG031`. This is a form of code inclusion, similar to `#include` in C/C++. The exact nature of `LTDRG031` (e.g., if it defines tables, subroutines, etc.) isn't explicitly stated here, but it's a dependency.

**2. List of SQL Queries (EXEC SQL blocks):**

*   There are no `EXEC SQL` blocks found in this program.

**3. List of CICS Calls (EXEC CICS blocks):**

*   There are no `EXEC CICS` blocks found in this program.

## Program: LTCAL042

**1. Calls to Databases, Web Services, Online Transaction Systems, or Other Programs:**

*   **COPY LTDRG031:** Similar to LTCAL032, this program includes code from `LTDRG031`.

**2. List of SQL Queries (EXEC SQL blocks):**

*   There are no `EXEC SQL` blocks found in this program.

**3. List of CICS Calls (EXEC CICS blocks):**

*   There are no `EXEC CICS` blocks found in this program.
