Here's an analysis of the provided COBOL programs:

## Program: LTCAL032

**1. Calls to other programs, databases, web services, or online transaction systems:**

*   **COPY LTDRG031:** This indicates that the data structures and potentially some logic defined in `LTDRG031` are included in this program. It's a form of code inclusion, not a direct call to an executable program.

**2. SQL Queries (EXEC SQL blocks):**

*   None found.

**3. CICS Calls (EXEC CICS blocks):**

*   None found.

## Program: LTDRG031

**1. Calls to other programs, databases, web services, or online transaction systems:**

*   This program appears to be a `COPY` library or a data definition file. It does not contain any executable logic that would make calls to other systems or programs. The content defines data structures (`W-DRG-FILLS` and `W-DRG-TABLE`).

**2. SQL Queries (EXEC SQL blocks):**

*   None found.

**3. CICS Calls (EXEC CICS blocks):**

*   None found.
