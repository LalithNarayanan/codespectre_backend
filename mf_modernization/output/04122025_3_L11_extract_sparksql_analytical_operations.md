Okay, I will analyze the provided PySpark programs according to your instructions. I will identify and describe the following aspects for each program:

*   **Spark SQL Queries:**  `spark.sql()` and `createOrReplaceTempView()` calls, along with their descriptions.
*   **Analytical Operations:** `agg`, `groupBy`, `pivot`, `unpivot`, `cube`, `rollup`.
*   **Statistical Functions:** `mean`, `stddev`, `percentile`, `corr`, `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`.
*   **Machine Learning/Predictive Logic:** Identification of any ML libraries or operations.
*   **Report Generation and Formatting Logic:**  How the results are presented.
*   **Business Application:** The purpose of each operation in a business context.

I will use markdown to format the analysis for clarity.
