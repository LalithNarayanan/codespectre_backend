## Execution Flow of SAS Programs

The execution flow describes the sequence in which the provided SAS programs should be run and the data dependencies between them.

**Step 1: 01_transaction_data_import**

*   **Description:** This program imports transaction data. This typically involves reading data from external sources (e.g., CSV files, databases) into SAS datasets.
*   **Input:** Raw transaction data (e.g., CSV file).
*   **Output:** A SAS dataset containing the imported transaction data.

**Step 2: 02_data_quality_cleaning**

*   **Description:** This program performs data quality checks and cleaning operations on the imported transaction data. This may include handling missing values, correcting data errors, and standardizing data formats.
*   **Input:** The SAS dataset created in Step 1.
*   **Output:** A cleaned SAS dataset, ready for further analysis.

**Step 3: 03_feature_engineering**

*   **Description:** This program creates new variables (features) from the existing data. These features are designed to improve the performance of machine learning models or rule-based detection systems. Examples include calculating transaction amounts, creating time-based variables, or deriving ratios.
*   **Input:** The cleaned SAS dataset from Step 2.
*   **Output:** A SAS dataset with engineered features.

**Step 4: 04_rule_based_detection**

*   **Description:** This program implements rule-based detection to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. It applies a set of predefined rules based on the engineered features.
*   **Input:** The feature-engineered SAS dataset from Step 3.
*   **Output:** A SAS dataset with flags or scores indicating transactions that triggered the rules, identifying potential fraud.

**Step 5: 05_ml_scoring_model**

*   **Description:** This program applies a machine learning model to score transactions. The model is trained on historical data and used to predict the likelihood of fraud for new transactions.
*   **Input:** The feature-engineered SAS dataset from Step 3.
*   **Output:** A SAS dataset with fraud scores generated by the machine learning model.

**Step 6: 06_case_management_output**

*   **Description:** This program consolidates the results from the rule-based detection (Step 4) and the machine learning model (Step 5) to generate output for case management. This output could include a list of transactions flagged as suspicious, along with relevant information for investigation.
*   **Input:** The output SAS datasets from Step 4 and Step 5.
*   **Output:** A final dataset or report summarizing potential fraudulent transactions, ready for review and action.

## Data Dependencies

*   `02_data_quality_cleaning` depends on the output of `01_transaction_data_import`.
*   `03_feature_engineering` depends on the output of `02_data_quality_cleaning`.
*   `04_rule_based_detection` depends on the output of `03_feature_engineering`.
*   `05_ml_scoring_model` depends on the output of `03_feature_engineering`.
*   `06_case_management_output` depends on the outputs of `04_rule_based_detection` and `05_ml_scoring_model`.
