Here's an analysis of the provided COBOL programs:

**Program: LTCAL032**

*   **Calls to External Systems:**
    *   None identified explicitly in the provided code.
*   **SQL Queries:**
    *   None identified.
*   **CICS Calls:**
    *   None identified.

**Program: LTCAL042**

*   **Calls to External Systems:**
    *   None identified explicitly in the provided code.
*   **SQL Queries:**
    *   None identified.
*   **CICS Calls:**
    *   None identified.

**Program: LTDRG031**

*   **Calls to External Systems:**
    *   None identified explicitly in the provided code.
*   **SQL Queries:**
    *   None identified.
*   **CICS Calls:**
    *   None identified.

**Summary of Findings**

*   None of the provided COBOL programs directly interact with databases, web services, or online transaction systems based on the code provided.
*   No SQL queries or CICS calls were found in any of the programs.
*   The programs appear to be self-contained calculation modules, likely used as subroutines within a larger system.
*   `LTDRG031` contains data used by the other two programs, specifically DRG codes, relative weights, and average lengths of stay.
