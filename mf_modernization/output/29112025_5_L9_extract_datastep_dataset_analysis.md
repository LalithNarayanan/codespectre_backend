Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (once they are provided) and deliver the requested details for each program. I will adhere strictly to your formatting guidelines, using only markdown syntax and avoiding tables and code snippets unless explicitly asked. I will analyze each program independently, documenting the requested aspects.

**Waiting for Program Content**

I am ready to receive the SAS program content. Please provide the code for:

*   `01_transaction_data_import`
*   `02_data_quality_cleaning`
*   `03_feature_engineering`
*   `04_rule_based_detection`
*   `05_ml_scoring_model`
*   `06_case_management_output`

Once I have the code, I will provide the analysis for each program as requested.
