Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program files and provide the requested details for each. Since the content of the files is not provided, I will respond with a placeholder response indicating the structure of the analysis I would perform once the file content is available.

**Placeholder Response Structure (to be populated with actual analysis)**

For each SAS program file (e.g., `01_transaction_data_import.sas`, `02_data_quality_cleaning.sas`, etc.), I will provide the following:

### **File: `01_transaction_data_import.sas` (Example)**

#### **1. Macro and Data Step Execution Order and Purpose**

*   **Macro/Data Step:** `(e.g., DATA step import_raw_data)`
    *   **Purpose:** (e.g., Imports transaction data from a CSV file into a SAS dataset.)
*   **Macro/Data Step:** `(e.g., %create_summary_stats)`
    *   **Purpose:** (e.g., Calculates and stores summary statistics for the imported data.)

#### **2. Business Rules Implemented**

*   (e.g., Rule 1: Filter out transactions with a transaction amount less than 0.)
*   (e.g., Rule 2: Convert date fields to the correct format.)

#### **3. IF/ELSE Conditional Logic Breakdown**

*   (e.g., `IF transaction_type = 'REFUND' THEN ... ELSE ...;`)
    *   **Explanation:** (e.g., If the transaction type is a refund, then...)

#### **4. DO Loop Processing Logic**

*   (e.g., `DO i = 1 TO 10; ... END;`)
    *   **Explanation:** (e.g., A loop that iterates 10 times, potentially performing calculations or transformations within each iteration.)

#### **5. Key Calculations and Transformations**

*   (e.g., Calculation of a new variable: `profit = revenue - cost;`)
*   (e.g., Transformation: Converting character variables to numeric variables.)

#### **6. Data Validation Logic**

*   (e.g., Checking for missing values in key fields.)
*   (e.g., Validating date formats.)

---

The above structure will be repeated for each of the SAS program files:

*   `02_data_quality_cleaning.sas`
*   `03_feature_engineering.sas`
*   `04_rule_based_detection.sas`
*   `05_ml_scoring_model.sas`
*   `06_case_management_output.sas`

**Important Note:** *This is a placeholder. The actual content will be filled in once the content of the SAS program files is provided.*
