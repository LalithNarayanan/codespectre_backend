Here's an analysis of the provided COBOL programs, including database interactions, CICS calls, and other external calls.

**COBOL Program: LTCAL032**

*   **Calls to External Programs/Subroutines:**

    *   COPY LTDRG031.  (This is a copybook inclusion, which means it pulls in the contents of the LTDRG031 file.  It's not a direct call, but it's an external dependency).

*   **No Database (SQL) Calls:**
*   **No CICS Calls:**
