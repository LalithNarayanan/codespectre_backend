Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the COBOL program code, and I will analyze it according to your specifications. I will follow the exact format you've outlined:

```markdown
>Business Logic:
>>Analysis of {file_name}:
>>>Program Overview:
>>>Paragraph Execution Order and Description:
>>>Business Rules:
>>>Data Validation and Error Handling Logic:
```

I will repeat this structure for each COBOL program you give me.  I'm eager to get started. Just paste the code!
