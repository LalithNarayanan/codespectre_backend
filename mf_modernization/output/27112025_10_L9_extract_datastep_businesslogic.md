Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (once they are provided) and provide the requested details for each program, formatted using markdown.  I will adhere strictly to the instructions, including:

*   Using markdown syntax.
*   Listing DATA steps, descriptions, business rules, conditional logic, DO loops, calculations, and data validation.
*   No tables or code snippets unless explicitly requested.
*   Analyzing all programs provided.

I'm ready. Please provide the content of the SAS programs: `01_transaction_data_import`, `02_data_quality_cleaning`, `03_feature_engineering`, `04_rule_based_detection`, `05_ml_scoring_model`, and `06_case_management_output`. I will begin the analysis as soon as the program contents are available.
