Okay, I'm ready to analyze your PySpark programs. Please provide the PySpark program code, and I will analyze it according to your instructions, focusing on the following aspects:

*   **Spark SQL Queries:** Identifying `spark.sql()` calls and `createOrReplaceTempView()` usage, along with descriptions.
*   **Analytical Operations:** Listing `agg`, `groupBy`, `pivot`, `unpivot`, `cube`, and `rollup` operations.
*   **Statistical Functions:** Identifying functions like `mean`, `stddev`, `percentile`, `corr`, `count`, `sum`, `min`, and `max`.
*   **Machine Learning/Predictive Logic:** Highlighting any machine learning or predictive modeling components.
*   **Report Generation/Formatting:** Describing any logic used to structure or present the results.
*   **Business Application:** Explaining the potential business use cases of the SQL queries and analytical operations.

I will format my response using Markdown for clarity and readability.
