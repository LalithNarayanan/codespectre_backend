Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program content (once you provide it) and identify the external connections and file operations, formatting the response according to your specifications. I will use the headings and structure you've outlined.  I'm ready for the program code. Please provide the content of each SAS program file (01_transaction_data_import, 02_data_quality_cleaning, etc.).
