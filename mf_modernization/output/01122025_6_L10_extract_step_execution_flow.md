### List of SAS Programs Analyzed

*   `SASPOC`
*   `DUPDATE`
*   `DREAD`

### Execution Sequence and Description

The execution sequence of DATA and PROC steps is determined by their order within each program and the dependencies between them.

*   **SASPOC:** The code in this program would be executed first.
*   **DUPDATE:** The code in this program would be executed second.
*   **DREAD:** The code in this program would be executed third.

**Note:** Without the actual content of the SAS programs, it's impossible to provide a detailed step-by-step description. The general principle is that SAS executes code sequentially within each program.

### Dataset Dependencies

Dataset dependencies cannot be determined without the content of the SAS programs. Generally, a step depends on a dataset if it reads from it or modifies it.

### Macro Execution Order

Macro execution order cannot be determined without the content of the SAS programs.

### RUN/QUIT Statement Trigger Points

RUN and QUIT statements signal the end of a DATA or PROC step or the end of the SAS session, respectively. Their impact depends on their placement within the code.

### List of Use Cases Addressed

Without the content of the SAS programs, it's impossible to determine the specific use cases addressed. However, the programs likely perform data manipulation, updating, and reading operations.
