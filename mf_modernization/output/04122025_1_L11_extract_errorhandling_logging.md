Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the PySpark programs one at a time. I will analyze each program and provide the requested details:

*   Error checking mechanisms
*   Logging statements
*   DataFrame validation
*   Exception handling in transformations and actions
*   Error output handling
*   Spark job failure conditions and retry logic

I will format my responses using markdown, as requested. I'll await the first PySpark program.
