Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program contents (once they are provided) and provide the requested details for each program. I will adhere strictly to the formatting instructions, using markdown and avoiding code snippets unless specifically asked. The analysis will cover error checking, logging, ABORT/STOP conditions, DATA step error handling, PROC SQL exception handling, and error output datasets/files.  I am ready to begin the analysis when the SAS program content is provided.
