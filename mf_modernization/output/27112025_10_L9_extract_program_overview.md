### Program: 01_transaction_data_import

*   **Overview of the Program:**
    This program likely focuses on importing raw transaction data from the "Transaction System" data source, as described in Context\_1. It would read the data, potentially from a CSV file, database, or other source, and prepare it for further processing.

*   **Business Functions Addressed:**
    *   Data Ingestion.

*   **Datasets Created and Consumed & Data Flow:**
    *   **Consumes:**
        *   Transaction data from the "Transaction System" (CSV, database, etc.).
    *   **Creates:**
        *   A SAS dataset containing the imported transaction data. This dataset will likely include the fields listed in Context\_3.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        `Transaction System Data`  ->  `01_transaction_data_import`  ->  `Transaction Data SAS Dataset`

### Program: 02_data_quality_cleaning

*   **Overview of the Program:**
    This program performs data quality checks and cleaning operations on the imported transaction data. This includes validating data against the rules specified in Context\_3 (e.g., NOT NULL, data type, range checks, and format validation). It also handles missing values, inconsistencies, and potentially standardizes data formats.

*   **Business Functions Addressed:**
    *   Data Quality Validation and Cleaning.

*   **Datasets Created and Consumed & Data Flow:**
    *   **Consumes:**
        *   The SAS dataset created by `01_transaction_data_import` (Transaction Data SAS Dataset).
    *   **Creates:**
        *   A cleaned and validated SAS dataset. This dataset may be the same as the input dataset, but with data quality issues corrected or flagged.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        `Transaction Data SAS Dataset`  ->  `02_data_quality_cleaning`  ->  `Cleaned Transaction Data SAS Dataset`

### Program: 03_feature_engineering

*   **Overview of the Program:**
    This program calculates new variables (features) from the cleaned transaction data. These features are used in the rule-based detection engine and the machine learning model. The features would be computed based on the business rules and model inputs described in Context\_2.

*   **Business Functions Addressed:**
    *   Feature Engineering.

*   **Datasets Created and Consumed & Data Flow:**
    *   **Consumes:**
        *   The cleaned transaction dataset created by `02_data_quality_cleaning` (Cleaned Transaction Data SAS Dataset).
    *   **Creates:**
        *   A SAS dataset with the engineered features added to the cleaned transaction data.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        `Cleaned Transaction Data SAS Dataset`  ->  `03_feature_engineering`  ->  `Transaction Data with Engineered Features SAS Dataset`

### Program: 04_rule_based_detection

*   **Overview of the Program:**
    This program implements the rule-based fraud detection engine. It evaluates the business rules defined in Context\_2 against the transaction data and generates alerts/flags for suspicious transactions.

*   **Business Functions Addressed:**
    *   Fraud Detection (Rule-Based).

*   **Datasets Created and Consumed & Data Flow:**
    *   **Consumes:**
        *   The dataset with engineered features created by `03_feature_engineering` (Transaction Data with Engineered Features SAS Dataset).
    *   **Creates:**
        *   A SAS dataset that includes the original transaction data, engineered features, and flags/scores indicating potential fraud based on the rules.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        `Transaction Data with Engineered Features SAS Dataset`  ->  `04_rule_based_detection`  ->  `Rule-Based Detection Results SAS Dataset`

### Program: 05_ml_scoring_model

*   **Overview of the Program:**
    This program applies the machine learning model to the transaction data. It uses the input features to predict the probability of fraud for each transaction and assigns risk scores accordingly.

*   **Business Functions Addressed:**
    *   Fraud Detection (Machine Learning).

*   **Datasets Created and Consumed & Data Flow:**
    *   **Consumes:**
        *   The dataset with engineered features created by `03_feature_engineering` (Transaction Data with Engineered Features SAS Dataset).
    *   **Creates:**
        *   A SAS dataset that includes the original transaction data, engineered features, and the fraud probability and risk scores generated by the machine learning model.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        `Transaction Data with Engineered Features SAS Dataset`  ->  `05_ml_scoring_model`  ->  `ML Scoring Results SAS Dataset`

---

### Program: 06_case_management_output

*   **Overview of the Program:**
    This program combines the results from the rule-based detection and the machine learning model, calculates the combined risk scores, prioritizes cases for investigation, and generates output for the case management system.

*   **Business Functions Addressed:**
    *   Case Prioritization and Investigation Queue Generation.

*   **Datasets Created and Consumed & Data Flow:**
    *   **Consumes:**
        *   The output from `04_rule_based_detection` (Rule-Based Detection Results SAS Dataset) - contains rule based flags.
        *   The output from `05_ml_scoring_model` (ML Scoring Results SAS Dataset) - contains ML scores.
    *   **Creates:**
        *   A SAS dataset (or other output format) containing prioritized cases for investigation, based on the combined risk scores. This could include information for an investigation queue, or a report for investigators.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        `Rule-Based Detection Results SAS Dataset` & `ML Scoring Results SAS Dataset` -> `06_case_management_output` -> `Investigation Queue / Case Management Output`
