Okay, I will analyze the provided SAS program files and provide the requested details for each one. Since the content of the files is not provided, I will respond with the structure that the response should follow.  I will adhere to the specified markdown formatting and will indicate where the content would go.

## Analysis of SAS Programs

I will analyze each SAS program file separately.  For each file, I will provide the following:

### 01_transaction_data_import

*   **List of DATA steps and macros (in execution order) and their purpose:**
    *   (e.g., `DATA` step 1: Imports transaction data from a CSV file, applying a format to the date variable.)
    *   (e.g., Macro `LOAD_DATA`: Encapsulates the import and basic data type assignment.)
*   **Business Rules Implemented:**
    *   (e.g., Rule 1: Filter transactions based on transaction type.)
    *   (e.g., Rule 2: Derive a new variable representing the transaction amount after applying a discount.)
*   **IF/ELSE Conditional Logic Breakdown:**
    *   (e.g., `IF` statement: Checks if the transaction amount is greater than a threshold.)
    *   (e.g., `ELSE` block: Actions to take if the transaction amount is not greater than the threshold.)
*   **DO Loop Processing Logic:**
    *   (e.g., `DO` loop: Iterates through a list of customer IDs to perform a specific calculation.)
    *   (e.g., `DO WHILE` loop: Processes transactions until a certain condition is met.)
*   **Key Calculations and Transformations:**
    *   (e.g., Calculation: Calculate the profit margin.)
    *   (e.g., Transformation: Convert a character variable to numeric.)
*   **Data Validation Logic:**
    *   (e.g., Validation: Check for missing values in a critical field.)
    *   (e.g., Validation: Ensure the transaction date falls within a valid range.)

I will repeat this structure for each of the six files. Please provide the content of each SAS program file so I can perform the analysis.
