          I have a detailed functional specification.  
          I want you to take a look at it from an object oriented design perspective.
          I prefer containment over inheritance. I dont want code, only the design

          I have a detailed functional specification and a baseline Object-Oriented Design document.  
          I want you to take a look at it from an object oriented design perspective.
          I prefer containment over inheritance. I dont want code, only the design
          Please update the following baseline Object-Oriented Design document 
            [ ```{parent_oo_design}```] 
          to incorporate the functionalities and requirements outlined   in these new functional specifications
