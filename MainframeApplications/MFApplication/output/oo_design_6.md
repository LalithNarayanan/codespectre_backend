Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment and avoiding inheritance as much as possible.  I will then analyze those specifications and provide a design that includes:

* **Identification of core objects:**  What are the key entities in your system?  These will become classes.
* **Relationships between objects:** How do these objects interact?  This will define the relationships (composition, aggregation) between classes.  I will focus on containment (composition and aggregation) as requested.
* **Responsibilities of each object:** What actions does each object perform?  This determines the methods within each class.
* **Attributes of each object:** What data does each object hold? This defines the member variables within each class.
* **Potential for future extension:** I will consider how the design could be easily extended to accommodate future features without significant restructuring.


Once you provide the functional specifications, I will deliver a well-structured object-oriented design adhering to your preferences.  The more detail you provide in your functional specifications, the more precise and helpful my design will be.
