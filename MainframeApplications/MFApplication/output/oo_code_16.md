Please provide the functional specifications for the system.  I need a detailed description of what the system should do to create a suitable object-oriented design and then generate the Java code.  For example, tell me:

* **What are the inputs to the system?** (e.g., user input, data from files, network requests)
* **What are the outputs of the system?** (e.g., reports, updated data, user interface displays)
* **What are the main processes or actions the system performs?** (e.g., calculations, data transformations, storage and retrieval)
* **What are the key entities or objects involved?** (e.g., customers, products, orders)
* **What are the relationships between these entities?** (e.g., a customer can place many orders, an order contains many products)
* **What are the constraints or rules that govern the system's behavior?** (e.g., validation rules, business logic)
* **Are there any specific performance requirements or scalability considerations?**

Once I have this information, I can design the system using composition and then implement it in Java, including the business logic.
