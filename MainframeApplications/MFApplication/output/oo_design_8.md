Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze those specifications and provide a design that includes:

* **Classes and Objects:**  Identification of key classes and their responsibilities, focusing on clear separation of concerns.
* **Relationships:**  Description of the relationships between classes (primarily containment/aggregation and association), avoiding inheritance where possible.  I will explain *why* containment is preferred in each case.
* **Attributes and Methods:**  Specification of the data (attributes) and operations (methods) for each class.
* **Data Structures:**  Suggestion of appropriate data structures to efficiently manage data within the objects.
* **Design Patterns (if applicable):**  Identification of relevant design patterns that can improve the design's flexibility, maintainability, and reusability.  I will justify the choice of pattern.


Once you provide the functional specifications, I will deliver a comprehensive object-oriented design adhering to your preference for containment.  The more detail you provide in your specifications, the more accurate and helpful my design will be.
