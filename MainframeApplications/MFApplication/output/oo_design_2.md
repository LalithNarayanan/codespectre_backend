Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze them and provide a design outlining the classes, their responsibilities, and relationships (primarily composition/containment) to achieve the specified functionality.  My response will include:

* **Class Diagram:**  A visual representation showing classes, their attributes, and relationships (using UML notation or a similar clear representation).
* **Class Descriptions:** A textual description of each class, explaining its responsibilities and key methods.
* **Relationship Explanations:**  A description of how classes interact, emphasizing containment relationships.
* **Potential Design Considerations:**  Any potential challenges or alternative design choices, highlighting the rationale for the chosen approach.


I will focus on creating a robust, maintainable, and extensible design that prioritizes clear separation of concerns and avoids the pitfalls of excessive inheritance.  The more detail you provide in your functional specifications, the more accurate and helpful my design will be.
