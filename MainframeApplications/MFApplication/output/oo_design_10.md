Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze them and provide a design outlining:

* **Classes and Objects:** Identification of key entities and their attributes.  I will focus on creating cohesive classes with well-defined responsibilities.
* **Relationships between Objects:**  This will primarily focus on containment ("has-a" relationships) rather than inheritance ("is-a" relationships).  I'll specify how objects are composed and how they interact.
* **Responsibilities and Methods:**  Defining the actions each object can perform.  This will ensure that each class has a single, well-defined purpose.
* **Potential Design Patterns:** If applicable, I will suggest relevant design patterns (like Composite, Strategy, etc.) to improve the design's flexibility and maintainability.
* **Data Structures:**  Suggesting appropriate data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

Once you provide the specifications, I can give you a robust and well-structured object-oriented design that prioritizes containment.
