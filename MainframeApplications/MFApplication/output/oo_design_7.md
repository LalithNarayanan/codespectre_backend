Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment and avoiding inheritance where appropriate.  I will then analyze it and provide a design focusing on:

* **Identifying key objects and their responsibilities:**  Each object should have a clear, single purpose.
* **Defining attributes and methods for each object:**  This will describe the data and behavior of each object.
* **Establishing relationships between objects:**  This will primarily focus on containment relationships (aggregation and composition) to show how objects are composed of other objects.
* **Considering interfaces (if applicable):** To promote loose coupling and flexibility.
* **Addressing potential design patterns:**  Where appropriate to improve design and solve recurring problems.

Once you provide the functional specifications, I will deliver a well-structured object-oriented design that prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.  The more detail you provide in your functional specifications, the more comprehensive and accurate my design will be.
