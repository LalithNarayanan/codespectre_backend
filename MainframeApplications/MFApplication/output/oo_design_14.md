Please provide the functional specifications.  I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment (composition) rather than inheritance.  

Once you provide the specifications, my response will include:

* **Identification of key objects and their responsibilities:**  This will detail the core objects within the system and what each is responsible for.  I'll focus on clearly defined responsibilities to promote low coupling and high cohesion.

* **Relationships between objects:** This will describe how the objects interact, emphasizing composition (containment) over inheritance.  I'll specify which objects contain other objects and the nature of those relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).

* **Object attributes and methods:** I will outline the essential data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) for each object.  This will be concise but sufficient to illustrate the object's role.

* **Potential design patterns (if applicable):** I will suggest relevant design patterns that might improve the design's flexibility, maintainability, and scalability, keeping in mind the preference for composition.

* **Considerations for scalability and maintainability:** I will highlight aspects of the design that contribute to or detract from scalability and maintainability.


I look forward to receiving your functional specifications so I can provide a thorough and helpful object-oriented design.
