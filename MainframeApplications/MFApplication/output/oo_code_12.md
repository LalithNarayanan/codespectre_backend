Please provide the functional specifications for the system.  I need a description of what the system should *do* before I can design and implement it using object-oriented principles and Java code.  For example, tell me:

* **What are the inputs?** (e.g., user data, files, sensor readings)
* **What are the outputs?** (e.g., reports, visualizations, database updates)
* **What are the main processes or tasks the system performs?** (e.g., data validation, calculations, data storage, user interaction)
* **What are the key business rules or constraints?** (e.g., validation rules, data relationships, security requirements)
* **Are there any specific performance requirements?** (e.g., response time, throughput)


Once I have this information, I will create an object-oriented design based on containment (composition) and then generate the corresponding Java code, incorporating the necessary business logic.
