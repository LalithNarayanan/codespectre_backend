Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze it and provide a design outlining the classes, their responsibilities, attributes, and relationships (primarily composition/containment).  My response will focus on the structure and not include any implementation code.
