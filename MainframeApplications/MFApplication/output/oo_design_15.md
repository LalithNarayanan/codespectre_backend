Please provide the functional specifications.  I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design that emphasizes containment over inheritance.  I will then analyze those specifications and provide a design outlining:

* **Classes and Objects:**  Identifying key entities and their attributes and responsibilities.  I will focus on creating cohesive classes with well-defined roles.

* **Relationships:**  Describing the relationships between classes, primarily focusing on *composition* (containment) rather than inheritance.  I'll explain how objects collaborate and share data.

* **Responsibilities:**  Clearly outlining what each class is responsible for, promoting low coupling and high cohesion.

* **Interfaces (if applicable):** Defining interfaces to specify contracts between classes, promoting flexibility and maintainability.

* **Potential Design Patterns (if applicable):**  Suggesting relevant design patterns (like Strategy, Composite, etc.) if they would improve the design's flexibility, scalability, or maintainability.  This will be done *only if appropriate* and will be justified.


Once you provide the functional specifications, I can give you a robust and well-structured object-oriented design that prioritizes containment.
