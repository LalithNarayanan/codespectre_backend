Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create a robust object-oriented design using containment over inheritance.  I will then analyze them and provide a design that:

* **Identifies key objects and their responsibilities:**  Each object will have a clear purpose and encapsulate its own data and methods.
* **Defines relationships between objects:**  This will primarily focus on containment (aggregation and composition) to minimize tight coupling and maximize flexibility.  I will explain the rationale behind choosing containment over inheritance in each case.
* **Considers potential scalability and maintainability:** The design will strive to be modular and easily extensible.
* **Addresses potential issues and complexities:**  I will highlight any potential design challenges or trade-offs.


Once you provide the functional specifications, I can give you a well-structured object-oriented design that meets your requirements.
