Okay, I need the functional specifications to create the Java code. Please provide a detailed description of the system's functionality.  The more detail you give me (including data types, expected inputs and outputs, error handling, etc.), the better the resulting object-oriented design and Java code will be.

For example, tell me:

* **What is the system supposed to do?**  What is its overall purpose?
* **What are the main entities or objects involved?** (e.g., customers, products, orders, etc.)
* **What are the actions or operations that can be performed on these entities?** (e.g., create a customer, add a product to an order, calculate the total price of an order, etc.)
* **What are the inputs and outputs for each operation?**  (e.g., input: customer name, address; output: customer ID)
* **What are the data types for each attribute?** (e.g., customer name: String, customer ID: Integer)
* **How should the system handle errors?** (e.g., what happens if a customer tries to order a product that is out of stock?)
* **Are there any specific performance requirements?** (e.g., response time, throughput)
* **Are there any external systems or databases involved?**


Once I have this information, I will provide:

1. **An Object-Oriented Design:** This will include a class diagram, class descriptions, relationship explanations, and potential design considerations, emphasizing composition over inheritance.

2. **Java Code:**  This will implement the design, incorporating the business logic you specify in the functional specifications.  The code will be well-structured, commented, and follow best practices.


I look forward to receiving your functional specifications so I can help you build your Java application.
