Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then provide a design that includes:

* **Classes and their responsibilities:**  Each class will have a clear, single responsibility.
* **Relationships between classes:**  Focusing on composition (containment) to represent "has-a" relationships rather than inheritance.
* **Attributes and methods:** For each class, I will identify key attributes and methods that implement the specified functionality.
* **Potential design patterns (if applicable):**  I will suggest appropriate design patterns to enhance modularity, flexibility, and maintainability, if relevant to the provided specifications.


Once you provide the specifications, I will analyze them and deliver a well-structured object-oriented design adhering to your preference for containment over inheritance.  The more detail you provide in your functional specifications, the more accurate and comprehensive my design will be.
