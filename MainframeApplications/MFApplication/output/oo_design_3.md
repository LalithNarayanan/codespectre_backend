Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze those specifications and provide a design focusing on:

* **Identifying key objects:**  What are the core entities in your system?  These will become classes.
* **Defining responsibilities:** What actions and data are associated with each object?  This helps determine methods and attributes.
* **Establishing relationships:** How do the objects interact? This will primarily focus on containment (composition/aggregation) relationships rather than inheritance.  I will specify the type of containment relationship (e.g., a `Car` *contains* an `Engine`, a `Library` *contains* many `Books`).
* **Considering encapsulation:**  How can we protect the internal state of objects and ensure data integrity?
* **Identifying potential interfaces:**  Are there common behaviors that different objects might share, which can be abstracted into interfaces? (While preferring containment, interfaces can still be beneficial for loose coupling.)

Once you provide the specifications, I will deliver a structured object-oriented design, explaining the rationale behind my choices.  The more detail you provide in your functional specifications (including use cases, data flow, and any constraints), the more accurate and comprehensive my design will be.
