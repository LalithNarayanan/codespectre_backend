Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create an object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze them and provide a design outlining the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (primarily composition/containment) to fulfill the requirements.  My response will focus on the structure and relationships, not on implementation details like specific code.
