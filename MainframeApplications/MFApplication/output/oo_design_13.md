Please provide the functional specifications. I need the details of the system's functionality to create a robust object-oriented design based on containment rather than inheritance.  I will then analyze them and provide a design outlining:

* **Classes and Objects:**  Identification of key classes and their responsibilities.  I will focus on creating cohesive classes with single responsibilities.
* **Relationships:**  Description of the relationships between classes, primarily focusing on containment ("has-a" relationships) instead of inheritance ("is-a" relationships).  This will include specifying how objects are composed of other objects.
* **Attributes:**  Specification of the data (attributes) each class will hold.
* **Methods:**  Specification of the operations (methods) each class will perform.  These will be focused on the responsibilities of each class.
* **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** How data and methods are hidden and accessed, ensuring data integrity and maintainability.
* **Potential Design Patterns:** If applicable, I will suggest appropriate design patterns that leverage containment to enhance the design (e.g., Composite, Decorator).


The more detail you provide in your functional specifications (including use cases, input/output, and any constraints), the more accurate and comprehensive my object-oriented design will be.
