Okay, let's design and implement a Java application.  To do this effectively, I need the functional specifications.  Please provide details about the system you want to build.  For example, tell me:


* **What is the system supposed to do?**  (e.g., manage a library, track inventory, process online orders, play a game, etc.)
* **What are the main entities involved?** (e.g., books, members, orders, products, players, etc.)
* **What are the key actions or operations the system should perform?** (e.g., add a book, borrow a book, return a book, place an order, update inventory, etc.)
* **What are the inputs and outputs for each operation?** (e.g., for adding a book: input – book title, author, ISBN; output – confirmation message)
* **What are the constraints or limitations?** (e.g., a member can only borrow a maximum of 5 books, inventory cannot go below zero, etc.)
* **Are there any specific reporting or data analysis requirements?** (e.g., generate a report of overdue books, calculate total sales, etc.)
* **What is the expected user interaction (if any)?** (e.g., command-line interface, graphical user interface, etc.)


Once I have this information, I will provide a detailed object-oriented design using containment and then generate the Java code implementing that design.  The code will include appropriate error handling and strive for best practices.
